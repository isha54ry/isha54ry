# Hey, I'm Isha 👋

Welcome to my GitHub space!

I'm a Computer Science undergrad at KIIT University (Class of 2026), currently diving deep into code, cloud, and a little bit of chaos (the good kind). I enjoy turning ideas into real-world projects — whether it's locking private photos using face recognition or tracking expenses on the cloud while I try not to overspend on coffee 😅.

## 💻 What I Code With

- **Languages:** C++, Python, Java, C, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Node.js, React, Bootstrap, MongoDB, MySQL, Git, AWS  
- **Concepts I vibe with:** Serverless Architecture, Face Recognition, Cloud Stuff ☁️  
- **Some subjects I actually liked:** ML, OS, DBMS, TCP/IP, OOP in Java

## 🧠 Projects I’ve Cooked Up

### 🔐 CognitoPics  
A face-based photo locker using Python, Streamlit & cryptography  
→ Finds and hides all photos of a selected person — like a stealth mode for memories  
→ Inspired by Google Photos' Locked Folder but with a twist  

### 💸 Expense Tracker  
Built with AWS Lambda, Node.js & DynamoDB  
→ A serverless app to track where my money is going (spoiler: snacks)  
→ Categorized spending + cloud-powered real-time updates  

### ❤️ Heart Disease Predictor  
Python + Scikit-learn  
→ Tested out Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest  
→ Tried to make predictions smarter with feature tuning and cross-validation  

### 📅 KEVENTS  
An event tracker for college built with Node.js, Java, and MySQL  
→ Keeps track of events from different clubs and societies  
→ Made for 1000+ students so no one misses out on free pizza

## 🎯 When I'm not coding...

I'm probably:
- playing volleyball 🏐  
- thinking 5 moves ahead in a game of chess ♟️
